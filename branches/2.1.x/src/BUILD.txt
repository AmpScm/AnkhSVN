**AnkhSVN source code**

Usage of the Ankh build environment requires at least:

  * Visual Studio 2008 (or 2005) Standard Edition or Higher (C# and C/C++ installed)
  * Visual Studio 2008 SDK (or Visual Studio 2005 SDK (4.0) for VS 2005)
  * A subversion client (e.g. AnkhSVN itself)
  * When using the VS 2005 SDK administrative permissions are required
  
And if you wish to build your own installers:

  * Votive (Including Wix 3.0) beta

Now you are ready to check out Ankh itself. Type the following:

    svn checkout http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/svn/ankhsvn/trunk/ ankhsvn

Open and build AnkhSvn.2008.sln (or AnkhSvn.2005.sln if you are using Visual
Studio 2005).  (Note: If you do not have WiX installed, you will get an error
when you open the solution.  This only signifies that VS.NET cannot build the
MSI package and will not keep you from building or debugging/running AnkhSVN
2.0 from within the IDE.)

When you build the AnkhSvn project inside the solution the AnkhSvn Package will
be registered in the so called 'Experimental Hive' (a special test environment
of your Visual Studio installation).  To run AnkhSVN 2.0 from within the IDE for
testing/debugging reasons, make sure to set the Ankh.Package as the default
startup project for the solution.

You can start Visual Studio with the experimental hive if you select the
'Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 under Experimental hive' icon below your
VS SDK group in the start menu. But it is easier to copy these settings to the
debug command of the AnkhSvn project by performing the following:

	1. Right-click the Ankh.Package project and select the "Properties" option.
	2. Select the Debug tab and put the path to devenv.exe for your appropriate
	   version of VS.NET into the "Start External Program" field.
	3. Based on the version of VS.NET, input the proper arguments into the
	   "Command line arguments" field.  (Options documented below.)

Experimental Hive Options

VS2008: 
	Default path to devenv: "%programfiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe"
	Default arguments: /rootSuffix Exp /RANU

VS2005:
	Default path to devenv: "%programfiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe"
	Default arguments: /rootSuffix Exp

(Note: Nothing below is required for development and/or testing/debugging Ankh
but is only mentioned in case you'd like to install the pre-release Ankh 2.0
into your non-experimental VS.NET IDE instance.  Perform at your own risk.)  To
register the package in your real Visual Studio you can use:

VS2008:
"%programfiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 SDK\VisualStudioIntegration\Tools\Bin\RegPkg.exe" src\AnkhSvn\bin\release\AnkhSvn.dll /codebase /root:Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0
"%programfiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.com" /setup

VS2005:
"%programfiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 SDK\2007.02\VisualStudioIntegration\Tools\Bin\RegPkg.exe" src\AnkhSvn\bin\release\AnkhSvn.dll /codebase /root:Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\8.0
"%programfiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.com" /setup


(To remove the package from your Visual Studio you can replace /codebase with /unregister)
