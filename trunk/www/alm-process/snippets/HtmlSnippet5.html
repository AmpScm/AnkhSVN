 AnkhSVN started as Arild&rsquo;s Fines' final year development project at the Oslo University in Norway. Karl Fogel (one of the Subversion &ldquo;originals&rdquo;) was Arild&rsquo;s outside mentor. Nowadays, AnkhSVN is a true open source project under an XXX-style license. Arild still leads the project and together with multiple committers develops the code. CollabNet hosts AnkhSVN, helps to grow the AnkhSVN community and contributes code to the project.
