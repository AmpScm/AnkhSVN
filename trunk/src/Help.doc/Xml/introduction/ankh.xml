    <p>
        The aim of Ankh is to provide an integration for the revision control 
        system Subversion (SVN) into the existing coding environment provided by Visual Studio .NET. 
        Most Windows programmers would rather avoid using the command prompts required to use 
        Subversion today. 
        <br/><br/>
        Because of Ankh, SVN is now available to Windows programmers, 
        and revision control is easier for programmers already using subversion and Visual Studio .NET. 
        Benefits of this addin are that be that SVN is accessed directly from within VS.NET 
        itself which leads to increased productivity.
        Ankh and Subversion are both open source.
