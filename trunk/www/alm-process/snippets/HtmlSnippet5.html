  AnkhSVN started as Arild Fines' final year development project at the Engineering Faculty of the Oslo College in Norway. Karl Fogel (one of the Subversion &ldquo;originals&rdquo;) was Arild&rsquo;s outside mentor. Arild continued the project while pursuing a master's degree in Informatics at the University of Oslo. Nowadays, AnkhSVN is a true open source project under an Apache-style license. Arild continue to leads the project with multiple committers developing the code. CollabNet hosts AnkhSVN to accelerate growth of the AnkhSVN community and adoption by development organizations around the world. CollabNet also contributes code to the project.
