<p><b>Document everything</b></p>

<p><b>Every function, whether public or internal, must start out
with a documentation comment that describes what the function does.
The documentation should mention every parameter received by the
function, every possible return value, and (if not obvious) the
conditions under which the function could return an error.<br>
<br>
 For internal documentation put the parameter names in upper case
in the doc string, even when they are not upper case in the actual
declaration, so that they stand out to human readers.<br>
<br>
 For public or semi-public API functions, the doc string should go
above the function in the .h file where it is declared; otherwise,
it goes above the function definition in the .c file.<br>
<br>
 For structure types, document each individual member of the
structure as well as the structure itself.<br>
<br>
 For actual source code, internally document chunks of each
function, so that an someone familiar with Subversion can
understand the algorithm being implemented. Do not include obvious
or overly verbose documentation; the comments should help
understanding of the code, not hinder it.<br>
