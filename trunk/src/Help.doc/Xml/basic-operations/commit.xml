                Send changes from your working copy to the repository.

                Working copy, repository

                <br/><br/><br/>
                A commit operation can publish changes to any number of files and directories as a single atomic transaction. 
                In your working copy, you can change files' contents, create, delete, rename and copy files and directories,
                and then commit the complete set of changes as a unit.
                <br/><br/>
                In the repository, each commit is treated as an atomic transaction: either all the commit's changes take 
                place, or none of them take place. Subversion tries to retain this atomicity in the face of program crashes, 
                system crashes, network problems, and other users' actions.
                <br/><br/>
                Each time the repository accepts a commit, this creates a new state of the filesystem tree, called a revision. 
                Each revision is assigned a unique natural number, one greater than the number of the previous revision. 
                The initial revision of a freshly created repository is numbered zero, and consists of nothing but an 
                empty root directory.
                <br/><br/>
                A nice way to visualize the repository is as a series of trees. Imagine an array of revision numbers, 
                starting at 0, stretching from left to right. Each revision number has a filesystem tree hanging below it, 
                and each tree is a snapshot of the way the repository looked after each commit.
