## 1. Welcome
 
  Thank you or checking out the sourcecode of AnkhSVN. You can always find
  the last version of this document on
 
    https://github.com/AmpScm/AnkhSVN
  
  If you have a Subversion client you can get the latest version of the 
  AnkhSVN sourcecode with the command:

  $ svn co https://github.com/ampscm/ankhsvn/trunk/ AnkhSVN
  
  If you have AnkhSVN 2.0 or later installed you can also automatically open the project
  directly in Visual Studio with AnkhSVN itself
  
    Click: File -> Open -> Subversion Project
  
  And then choose the right Solution (.sln) file below:
     https://github.com/ampscm/ankhsvn/trunk/src/
     
  In the next dialog choose a location where you wish to store your local
  working copy and click Ok.

  Of course you can also use your favorite git client to access our GitHub repository.
  
  
  Please read src/BUILD.txt for more information on how to test development
  versions of AnkhSVN after the checkout completes.
