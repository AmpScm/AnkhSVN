               <ul>   <li>Read the Frequently Asked Questions (below).</li>     <li>Search the <a href="/servlets/ProjectIssues">AnkhSVN issue database</a>  and check if the issue is already known. <br />
            </li>     <li>If you are not absolutely sure the issue is actually a bug, <a href="/servlets/ForumMessageList?forumID=75">ask in the support forum</a> .</li>     <li>Read the documentation on <a href="/servlets/ProjectProcess?documentContainer=c4__How%20to%20report%20bugs">how to submit an issue</a> .</li>     <li>Submit your defect report. </li>   </ul>               
<p>
            Please follow this process and keep the bug database clean so the AnkhSVN committers can focus on developing new code, rather than vetting the bug database.<br />
