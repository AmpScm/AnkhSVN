        <section header="Does AnkhSVN work with VS.NET 2003?">
            <p>The first release does not "officially" support VS.NET 2003. It will work for the most part, but 
            you may run into problems with C++ projects since 2003 uses a different version of VCProjectEngine.dll. The
            next release will support 2003 fully.</p>

        <section header="I get a message about not being able to attach to Solution Explorer?">
            <p>This is a known bug. It happens if you have your solution explorer window set to auto-hide. The only
            workaround is to not have it set on auto-hide while a project loads. Once the project is fully loaded you can
            set it back on auto-hide again. This bug is fixed in HEAD and the fix will be incorporated in the next release.</p>

        <section header="There is nothing about my problem here!">
            <p>Don't despair. Either send a mail to our developers mailing list(dev AT ankhsvn.tigris.org) describing the 
            problem(in as much detail as possible) or visit us in our IRC channel #ankhsvn on the irc.freenode.net server.</p>
