A developer will examine it and maybe talk to other developers, then estimate the bug's severity, the effort required to fix it, and schedule it in a numbered milestone, for example 1.1. (Or they may put it the unscheduled or nonblocking milestone, if they consider it tolerable for all currently planned releases.)  </p>  <p> An issue filed under &quot;unscheduled&quot; might still get fixed soon, if a committer or patch contributor decides he or she wants it done. Putting it in unscheduled merely means it hasn't been scheduled for any particular release yet. The nonblocking milestone, on the other hand, means that we do not anticipate ever scheduling the issue for a particular release. This also does not mean the issue will never be fixed; it merely means that we don't plan to block any release on it. <br /> Severity is represented in the Priority field. Here is how priority numbers map to severity: </p> <ul><li>P1: Prevents work from getting done, causes data loss, or BFI (&quot;Bad First Impression&quot;).</li><li>P2: Workaround required to get stuff done.</li><li>P3: Like P2, but rarely encountered in normal usage.</li><li>P4: Developer concern only</li><li>P5: Nice to fix, but we can live with it.</li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p>
