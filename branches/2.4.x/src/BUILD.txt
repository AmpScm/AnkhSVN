** AnkhSVN source code **

Usage of the Ankh build environment requires at least:

  * Visual Studio 2012, 2010, 2008 (or 2005) Standard Edition or Higher
    (The C# and C/C++ parts must be installed)
  * Visual Studio 2012, 2010 or 2008 SDK for developing in VS 2012, 2010, 2008.
  * Visual Studio 2005 SP1 SDK (4.0) for developing in Visual Studio 2005.
  * A subversion client (e.g. AnkhSVN itself)
  * When using the VS 2005 SDK administrative permissions are required. Later
    SDK versions work without administrative permissions.
  
If you wish to build your own installers:

  * Votive 3.6 (Including Wix 3.6)
  * Replicating our published setups requires VS2008 with the 2008 SDK and
    VS2010 with the 2010 SDK.

Now you are ready to check out AnkhSVN itself. Type the following:

  $ svn checkout http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/svn/ankhsvn/trunk/ ankhsvn

  * Open and build AnkhSvn.2012.sln, AnkhSvn.2010.sln, AnkhSvn.2008.sln or
    AnkhSvn.2005.sln depending on your Visual Studio version.

Or use AnkhSVN in your Visual Studio:
  * File->Open->Subversion Project
  * Type 'http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/svn/ankhsvn/trunk/src/
  * Pick the right .sln file for your Visual Studio version
  * Perform the checkout

Note: If you do not have Votive installed, you will get an error when you open
the solution for the first time.  This only tells you that Visual Studio cannot
build the MSI package. It will not break building or debugging/running AnkhSVN
from within the IDE.

When you build the AnkhSvn project inside the solution the AnkhSvn Package will
be registered in the so called 'Experimental Hive' (a special test environment
of your Visual Studio installation).  To run AnkhSVN from within the IDE for
testing/debugging reasons, make sure to set the Ankh.Package as the default
startup project for the solution.

You can start Visual Studio with the experimental hive if you select the
'Start Microsoft Visual Studio XXXX under Experimental hive' icon below your
VS SDK group in the start menu. But it is easier to copy these settings to the
debug command of the AnkhSvn project by performing the following:

	1. Right-click the Ankh.Package project and select the "Properties" option.
	2. Select the Debug tab and put the path to devenv.exe for your appropriate
	   version of VS.NET into the "Start External Program" field.
	3. Based on the version of VS.NET, input the proper arguments into the
	   "Command line arguments" field.  (Options documented below.)

Experimental Hive Options

VS2012:
   Default path to devenv: "%programfiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe"
   Default arguments: /rootSuffix Exp

VS2010:
   Default path to devenv: "%programfiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe"
   Default arguments: /rootSuffix Exp

VS2008: 
	Default path to devenv: "%programfiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe"
	Default arguments: /rootSuffix Exp /RANU

VS2005:
	Default path to devenv: "%programfiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe"
	Default arguments: /rootSuffix Exp


** Installing your own build in Visual Studio **

(Note: Nothing below is required for development and/or testing/debugging Ankh
but is only mentioned in case you'd like to install the pre-release AnkhSVN
into your non-experimental VS.NET IDE instance.  Perform at your own risk.)  To
register the package in your real Visual Studio you can use:

VS2010 and later:
Install the .vsix file that is generated by the Solution

VS2008:
"%programfiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 SDK\VisualStudioIntegration\Tools\Bin\RegPkg.exe" src\Ankh.Package\bin\release\Ankh.Package.dll /codebase /root:Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0
"%programfiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.com" /setup

VS2005:
"%programfiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 SDK\2007.02\VisualStudioIntegration\Tools\Bin\RegPkg.exe" src\Ankh.Package\bin\release\Ankh.Package.dll /codebase /root:Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\8.0
"%programfiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 8.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.com" /setup

(To remove the package from your Visual Studio you can replace /codebase with /unregister)
