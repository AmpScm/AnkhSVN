                <b>Description</b>
                <br/>
                    Create a directory with a name given by the final component of TARGET. 
                    If TARGET is a working copy path the directory is scheduled for addition in the 
                    working copy. If TARGET is an URL the directory is created in the repository 
                    via an immediate commit. In both cases all the intermediate directories must 
                    already exist.
