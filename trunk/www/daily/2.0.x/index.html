<h1>AnkhSVN-Daily Update</h1>


<p>
          The AnkhSVN project provides Daily builds of the current development tree. These versions
          are not tested before uploading, but may contain bugfixes (and new bugs) that are not in
          released versions. If you are testing our daily builds (Thanks!) and find issues in them,
          please report those issues with the exact version (See the Visual Studio about box).
        </p>


<h2>
          The latest daily build is <a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/files/documents/175/3051/AnkhSvn-Daily-2.0.7783.280.msi">AnkhSVN 2.0.7783</a>.
        </h2>



<p>
          You can find older daily releases in the <a href="http://ankhsvn.net/daily/?all=1">daily folder</a> of documents &amp; files.
          The previous version of this report is still available in our <a href="http://ankhsvn.net/daily/?id=7783&amp;tag=2.0.x">Subversion Repository</a>.
        </p><p>Published daily builds will be available for at least a week after they are build.</p>
