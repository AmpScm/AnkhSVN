<p>We maintain a uniform style for commit messages in the AnkhSVN
repository. When submitting a patch, please include a log message
in your email, following these guidelines:</p>

<p><br>
 At the top, write a brief summary of the intent of the commit -
for example, what the commit does. Follow that with a blank
line.</p>

<p>For each file affected by the commit, write an asterisk followed
by a space followed by the path to the file. Under that, list each
method changed in the file, indented by a tab and enclosed in
parentheses, and write a short comment as to what changed in this
method. These comments should be full sentences and thusly
capitalized.<br>
<br>
 The log message from r1367 is a good example:</p>

<pre>
Create a submenu on the Tools menu named "AnkhSVN".
 
* \src\Ankh\CommandMap.cs
    (LoadCommands) - Call CreateAnkhSubMenu().
    (CreateAnkhSubMenu) - Creates the new menu.<a href=

</pre>

Writing good log message is very important to the project .
