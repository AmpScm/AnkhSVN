<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><b>Document everything</b><p>&nbsp;</p>        <p>  Every function, whether public or internal, must start out with a documentation comment that describes what the function does. The documentation should mention every parameter received by the function, every possible return value, and (if not obvious) the conditions under which the function could return an error.<br />  <br />  For internal documentation put the parameter names in upper case in the doc string, even when they are not upper case in the actual declaration, so that they stand out to human readers.<br />  <br />  For public or semi-public API functions, the doc string should go above the function in the .h file where it is declared; otherwise, it goes above the function definition in the .c file.<br />  <br />  For structure types, document each individual member of the structure as well as the structure itself.<br />  <br />  For actual source code, internally document chunks of each function, so that an someone familiar with Subversion can understand the algorithm being implemented. Do not include obvious or overly verbose documentation; the comments should help understanding of the code, not hinder it. <br />  <br />                                                    </p>
