            Revisions: Numbers, Keywords, and Dates.
            Before we go on, you should know a bit about how to identify a particular revision in your repository. 
            A revision is a “snapshot” of the repository at a particular moment in time. 
            As you continue to commit and grow your repository, you need a mechanism for identifying these snapshots.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Revision Numbers</b>
            <br/>
            When you create a new Subversion repository, it begins its life at revision zero and 
            each successive commit increases the revision number by one. 
            After your commit completes, the Subversion client informs you of the new revision number.
            <br/><br/>
            $ svn commit --message "Corrected number of cheese slices."
            <br/>
            Sending        sandwich.txt
            <br/>
            Transmitting file data .
            <br/>
            Committed revision 3.
            <br/><br/>                  
            If at any point in the future you want to refer to that revision (
            We'll see how and why we might want to do that later in this chapter), 
            you can refer to it as “3”.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Revision Keywords</b>
            <br/>
            The Subversion client understands a number of revision keywords. 
            <br/><br/>
            <list>
                <item>HEAD - The latest revision in the repository.</item>
                <item>BASE  - The “pristine” revision of an item in a working copy.</item>
                <item>COMMITTED - The last revision in which an item changed.</item>
                <item>PREV  - The revision just before the last revision in which an item changed. (Technically, COMMITTED - 1).</item>
            </list>
