            <b>Why Ankh ? </b><br/><br/>
		    Subversion is the successor of a widely used revision control system 
		    named CVS. Subversion was initially founded to improve CVS. The 
		    initial goal of  Subversion was to preserve the same functionality as 
		    CVS and fixing the most obvious flaws. 
		    Subversion is recommended because it 
		    is a useful, free tool which offers an improvement of the widely used 
		    CVS.

            system Subversion into VS.NET. Today there are several revision 
            control systems available as an addin to VS.NET on the marked, but 
            non of them are free.
