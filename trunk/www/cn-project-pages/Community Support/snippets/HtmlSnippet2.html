IE is there an equivalent of &quot;checked out by me&quot;, &quot;checked by other&quot; as in Visual Source Safe?</b></p><p>Yes, later snapshots of AnkhSVN supports locking via the Lock and Unlock commands. It also has icons to indicate the lock status of a file.</p><p><a name="7"></a><b>How does Ankh determine whether a solution is version controlled?</b></p><p>Whenever VS.NET loads a solution, Ankh looks at the directory that contains the solution(.sln) file. If this directory is version controlled, Ankh will present the user with a choice whether Ankh should be enabled for the current solution. You can also choose to have Ankh load for a single session only.</p><p><a name="8"></a><b>I selected No when asked whether to load Ankh for my solution. Now I have changed my mind!</b></p><p>Right click on the solution node in the Solution Explorer and select Ankh-&gt;Toggle Ankh for this solution.<br /></p><p><a name="9"></a><b>What is the optimal solution layout for Ankh?</b></p><p>Ankh will perform best(solution load time, refresh time etc...) when the file system layout of the solution follows the logical layout. That means something like this:<br /><br />&nbsp;SolutionDir\<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solution.sln<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Project1\<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File1.cs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File2.cs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SubNamespace\<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File3.cs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File4.cs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Project1.csproj<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Project2\<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foo.vb<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bar.vb<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SubFoo\<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moo.vb<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Project2.vbproj<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Project3<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ooga.cpp<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ooga.h<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chacka.cpp<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chacka.h<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Project3.vcproj<br /><br />VS will create this kind of layout for you if you check the &quot;Create directory for solution&quot; checkbox when creating a new project. </p><p><a name="10"></a>But I can't create a layout like that with ASP.NET 2003 projects!
