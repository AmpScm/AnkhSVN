        Ankh is hooked directly into Visual Studios delete command. 
        If you delete a file with Visual Studio, 
        the file is automatically deleted from the working copy. 
        Items specified are scheduled for deletion upon the next commit. 
        Files (and directories that have not been committed) are 
        immediately removed from the working copy.
