Changes:

Version 0.2.5  (Aug 2003 16:53:13 +0200, revision 854)

Changes:
* intermediate release, besides Subversion 0.28.2 compatibility, there 
are no new features.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2.1 (released Aug 2003 02:23:45 +0200, revision 831)

Changes:
* updated the MSI package, there was  a small flaw in the installer. The 
installer originally failed to set the LoadBehavior registry key for the 
addin to 1, meaning that the addin wouldn't automatically load with VS.NET 
after the initial startup.

If you already have the original package, there is no need to get the new 
one. To ensure Ankh loads automatically when VS.NET starts,  just go into the 
Tools->Addin Manager.. dialog and check the Startup checkbox next to "AnkhSVN 
Addin"(That is, of course, if you want Ankh to load automatically with VS.NET).


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes:
* Supports both VS.NET 2002 and 2003 in a single installer.
* Solution explorer shows the status of all files in your working copy(svn 
status).
* You can view selected files in the Repository Explorer(svn cat).
* You can commit(svn commit), update(svn update), add(svn add), revert(svn 
revert) and run diffs(svn diff) against the text base from within VS.NET. 
This works on the solution, individual projects, folders and files.
* Ankh calls svn delete on files deleted from the IDE.
* You can clean up a locked working copy(svn cleanup)
* You can resolve a conflict(svn resolve)
* The Properties window shows svn info-style information about a file or a 
directory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.1 (Alpha 1) (released 14 May 2003 18:30:33 +0200, revision 572)
This release was built against Subversion 0.22.2

Changes:
* The VS.NET solution explorer shows the status of all files in your working 
copy
* You can commit, update, add, revert and run diffs against the text base 
from within VS.NET. This works on the solution, individual projects, folders 
and files.
* You can write your log messages from within VS.NET
* Ankh calls svn delete on files deleted from the IDE.
* Ankh detects new files added to a project


Some known issues:
- There is a known issue with the setup process in that sometimes the menu entries added by Ankh don't show up in VS.NET on the first run after the installation. On subsequent runs they are present.
- Currently, only VS.NET 2002 is officially supported, but we are interested in hearing from you if you attempt to install it under VS.NET 2003
- You will still need to use the svn command line client for some of the more advanced Subversion operations, and you should download the Windows version of the Subversion tools from http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList
