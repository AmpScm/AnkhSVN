    <div class="h1"><h1>History of AnkhSVN</h1></div>
  
    <p>AnkhSVN started as Arild Fines' final year development project at
    the Engineering Faculty of the Oslo College in Norway. Karl Fogel (one
    of the Subversion &ldquo;originals&rdquo;) was Arild&rsquo;s outside mentor.
    Arild continued the project while pursuing a master's degree in Informatics
    at the University of Oslo. Nowadays, AnkhSVN is a true open source project
    under an Apache-style license.
    </p>
    
    <p>In Februari 2008 the decision was made to rewrite the AnkhSVN engine to
    create a full Source Code Control Package (SCC) for Visual Studio 2005, 2008
    (and later versions) on top of the new SharpSvn library. The new&nbsp;engine
    will be the base of the new 2.X releases which saw its initial release in
    June 2008. This new version integrates deeply in Visual Studio to give better
    performance, stability and usability. The new Pending Changes window gives an
    up-to-date overview of all your project actions and provides easy access to
    most subversion commands.
    </p>
    
    <p>Development of the 2.X series continues and more and more of the original
    planned and user suggested features are added. Currently the focus is on
    usability and tree conflicts. Daily builds of the work in progress are
    always available on our <a title="AnkhSVN Daily Downloads"
    href="http://ankhsvn.net/daily/">daily page</a>.</p>
    
    <p>CollabNet hosts and supports the AnkhSVN project with the goal to accelerate
    growth of the AnkhSVN community and adoption by development organizations around
    the world. CollabNet also contributes code to the project. AnkhSVN is licensed
    under the <a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/ankhsvn/license/">Apache 2.0
    </a> license.
