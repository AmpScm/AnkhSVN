                <b>Description</b>
                <br/>
                Reverts any local changes to a file or directory and resolves any conflicted states. 
                svn revert will not only revert the contents of an item in your working copy, 
                but also any property changes. 
                Finally, you can use it to undo any scheduling operations that you may have done 
                (e.g. files scheduled for addition or deletion can be unscheduled).
