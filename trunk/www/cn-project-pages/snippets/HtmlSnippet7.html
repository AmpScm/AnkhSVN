The software allows you to perform the most common version control operations directly from inside the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE. With AnkhSVN you no longer need to leave your IDE to perform tasks like viewing the status of your source code, updating your Subversion working copy and committing changes. You can even browse your repository and you can plug-in your favorite diff tool.  </p><p> AnkhSVN is an active open source project with multiple committers from around the world (including CollabNet). AnkhSVN is currently in <a href="/files/documents/175/399/AnkhSetup-1.0.2.2778">release 1.0.2</a> and the community is working hard on the next release.
