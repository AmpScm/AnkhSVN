Attached find the marketing doc you sent me last week.

This was a very painful document to write; I'm obviously not suited for a position in a marketing department ;-)

If you have some suggestions for changes, please let me know.

I've attached the pictures separately; something weird seems to have happened to them in the document.

BTW: Is the repos live now? You seem to have fixed the revisions and the layout problem?
