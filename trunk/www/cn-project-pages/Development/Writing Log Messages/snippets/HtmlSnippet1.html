When submitting a patch, please include a log message in your email, following these guidelines:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At the top, write a brief summary of the intent of the commit - for example, what the commit does. Follow that with a blank line.</p><p>For each file affected by the commit, write an asterisk followed by a space followed by the path to the file. Under that, list each method changed in the file, indented by two spaces and enclosed in parentheses, and write a short comment as to what changed in this method. These comments should be full sentences and thusly capitalized.<br /><br />The following log message is a good example :</p><pre>Frub the frobbles&nbsp;</pre><pre>* subversion/libsvn_ra_pigeons/twirl.c   (twirling_baton_*): Removed these obsolete structures.   (handle_parser_warning): Pass data directly to callees, instead      of storing in twirling_baton_*.  * subversion/libsvn_ra_pigeons/twirl.h: Fix indentation. </pre>Writing good log message is very important to the project .
