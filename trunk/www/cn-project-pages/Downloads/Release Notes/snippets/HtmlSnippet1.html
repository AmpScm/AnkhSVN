  Some known issues: - There is a known issue with the setup process in that sometimes the menu entries added by Ankh don't show up in VS.NET on the first run after the installation. On subsequent runs they are present. - Currently, only VS.NET 2002 is officially supported, but we are interested in hearing from you if you attempt to install it under VS.NET 2003 - You will still need to use the svn command line client for some of the more advanced Subversion operations, and you should download the Windows version of the Subversion tools from http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList
