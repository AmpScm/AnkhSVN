<p>To submit an Issue, you have to be a Participant in the AnkhSVN
project. <a href=
"http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest">Request
to be a Participant</a>.</p>

<p><b>Submitting an Issue</b></p>

<p>Before you file a new issue, please:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read the <a href=
"/wiki/Faq">Frequently Asked
Questions</a>.<br>
</li>

<li>Search the <a href="/servlets/ProjectIssues">AnkhSVN issue
database</a> and check if the issue is already known.<br>
</li>

<li>If you are not absolutely sure the issue is actually a bug, <a
href=
"http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/ds/viewForumSummary.do?dsForumId=582">
ask in the support forum</a>.</li>

<li><a href="/servlets/ProjectIssues">Submit your defect
report</a>.</li>
</ul>

Please follow this process and keep the bug database clean so the
AnkhSVN committers can focus on developing new code, rather than
vetting the bug database.<br>
 

<p><b>What the Issue Fields Mean</b><br>
</p>

<p>When an issue is first filed, it automatically goes in the "---"
target milestone, which indicates that the issue has not been
processed yet. A developer will examine it and maybe talk to other
developers, then estimate the bug's severity, the effort required
to fix it, and schedule it in a numbered milestone, for example
1.1. (Or they may put it the unscheduled or nonblocking milestone,
if they consider it tolerable for all currently planned
releases.)</p>

<p>An issue filed under "unscheduled" might still get fixed soon,
if a committer or patch contributor decides he or she wants it
done. Putting it in unscheduled merely means it hasn't been
scheduled for any particular release yet. The nonblocking
milestone, on the other hand, means that we do not anticipate ever
scheduling the issue for a particular release. This also does not
mean the issue will never be fixed; it merely means that we don't
plan to block any release on it.<br>
 Severity is represented in the Priority field. Here is how
priority numbers map to severity:</p>

<ul>
<li>P1: Prevents work from getting done, causes data loss, or BFI
("Bad First Impression").</li>

<li>P2: Workaround required to get stuff done.</li>

<li>P3: Like P2, but rarely encountered in normal usage.</li>

<li>P4: Developer concern only</li>

<li>P5: Nice to fix, but we can live with it.</li>
</ul>
