                Besides the status icons, Ankh gives you a more detailed view of the changes made to files. 
                This is done with the ‘Diff’ command.

                    Display the differences between two paths. Each TARGET can be either a working copy path or URL. 
                    If TARGET is a working copy path, then the client compares base and working copies of TARGET.
