            It is possible to revert changes done to a file. 
            A reverted file is put back to the exact state it was in before you started working on it.  
            This is done with the <b>Revert</b> command. 
        </p>
        <b>How to revert files:</b>
        <list>
            <item>
                <b>1.</b>Select and right click on the file(s) you want to revert in Solution Explorer. 
                         A menu will pop up.
            </item>
            <item>
                <b>2.</b>Select <b>Revert</b> from the menu.
                <br/><br/>
                <img src="../../img/menu-items/revert.png" align="left"/>
                <br clear="all"/>
                <br/>
            </item>
        </list>
        Notice how the status icons in front of the files change from 
        <img src="../../img/modified_file.png"/> back to <img src="../../img/ok_file.png" />.
        <br clear="all"/>        
         Ankhs <link url="../keywords/output_window.xml">output window </link>
        will show all the files that have been reverted. 
        <br/><br/>
        <b>NOTE:</b> It is not possible to revert a revert command. When you revert an item, all changes you have done to this file will be deleted permanently.
