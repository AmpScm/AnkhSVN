------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2.1 (released Aug 2003 02:23:45 +0200, revision 831)

Changes:
* updated the MSI package, there was  a small flaw in the installer. The 
installer originally failed to set the LoadBehavior registry key for the 
addin to 1, meaning that the addin wouldn't automatically load with VS.NET 
after the initial startup.

If you already have the original package, there is no need to get the new 
one. To ensure Ankh loads automatically when VS.NET starts,  just go into the 
Tools->Addin Manager.. dialog and check the Startup checkbox next to "AnkhSVN 
Addin"(That is, of course, if you want Ankh to load automatically with VS.NET).

This works on the solution, individual projects, folders and files.
* Ankh calls svn delete on files deleted from the IDE.
* You can clean up a locked working copy(svn cleanup)
* You can resolve a conflict(svn resolve)

- Currently, only VS.NET 2002 is officially supported, but we are interested in hearing from you if you attempt to install it under VS.NET 2003
- You will still need to use the svn command line client for some of the more advanced Subversion operations, and you should download the Windows version of the Subversion tools from http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList
