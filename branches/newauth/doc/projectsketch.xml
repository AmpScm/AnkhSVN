    <section header="About CollabNet">
           <p> <!-- <img src="collabnet_logo.gif" align=left hspace=10/> -->
           CollabNet provides companies with solutions for Collaborative
           Software Development (CSD) by combining a Web-based software
           application with a suite of consulting services. </p>

           <p>
           CollabNet is currently working with several Fortune 500 and 
           industry-leading enterprise companies, 
           including: Barclays Global Investors (BGI), Dresdner 
           Kleinwort Wasserstein (DrKW), Hewlett-Packard (HP), 
           Oracle, and Sun Microsystems. Brian Behlendorf, co- founder 
           of the Apache Software Foundation, 
           established CollabNet in July 1999.</p>

         </link>Subversion
        <link url="http://subversion.tigris.org">http://subversion.tigris.org</link>
        is a  free/open-source revision control system that makes it easier for several
        programmers to cooperate within a set of files. All the files are stored
        on a server where each individual programmer checks out a working copy and
        works with that copy. During the project period these files are updated
        and synchronised with the repository. The repository is much like an ordinary file server, 
        except that it remembers every change ever made to your files. 
        This allows you to recover older versions of your files, 
        or browse the history of how your files changed.</p>

        <p>We intend to create a set of .NET assemblies that wrap the 
        Subversion(svn) client API. Further, we will use this wrapper to 
        create a Visual Studio.NET addin for svn. This will allow source control 
        operations to be performed from within Visual Studio itself. Such 
        integration with the IDE will make svn a viable alternative even for 
        Microsoft-centric development shops, which currently mostly use Sourcesafe.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section header="Platform/tools">
        <p>The addin itself will primarily be written in C# on the Windows/.NET platform, 
        with some C/C++/Managed C++ 
        used for the glue layer against the Subversion client API(which is written in C). 
        The natural development tool to use 
        here is Visual Studio .NET. Other tools that might be used include
        NUnit, a testing framework for .NET, NAnt, a build system and of course 
        Subversion itself for source control.</p>
