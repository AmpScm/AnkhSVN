        Ankh is hooked directly into Visual Studios delete command, 
        so when deleting a file with Visual Studio, 
        the file is automatically deleted from the working copy. 
        Items specified are scheduled for deletion upon the next commit. 
        Files (and directories that have not been committed) are immediately removed from the working copy.
