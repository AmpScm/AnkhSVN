1. Welcome
----------
 
  Thank you or checking out the sourcecode of AnkhSVN. You can always find
  the last version of this document on
 
    http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/svn/ankhsvn/trunk/README.txt
    (Username: guest, no password)
  
  If you have a Subversion client you can get the latest version of the 
  AnkhSVN sourcecode with the command:

  # svn co http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/svn/ankhsvn/trunk/ AnkhSVN
  
  If you have AnkhSVN 2.0 installed you can also automatically open the project
  directly in Visual Studio with AnkhSVN itself
  
    Click: File -> Open -> Subversion Project
  
  And then choose the right Solution (.sln) file below:
     http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/svn/ankhsvn/trunk/src/
     
  In the next dialog choose a location where you wish to store your local
  working copy and click Ok.
  
  
  Please read src/BUILD.txt for more information on how to test development
  versions of AnkhSVN after the checkout completes.
