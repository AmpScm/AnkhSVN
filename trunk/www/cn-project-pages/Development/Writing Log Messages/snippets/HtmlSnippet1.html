 We maintain a uniform style for commit messages in the AnkhSVN repository. When submitting a patch, please include a log message in your email, following these guidelines:  
</p>
  
<p>
 <br />
 At the top, write a brief summary of the intent of the commit - for example, what the commit does. Follow that with a blank line.  
</p>
  
<p>
 For each file affected by the commit, write an asterisk followed by a space followed by the path to the file. Under that, list each method changed in the file, indented by a tab and enclosed in parentheses, and write a short comment as to what changed in this method. These comments should be full sentences and thusly capitalized.<br />
