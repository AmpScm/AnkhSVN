<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><p>AnkhSVN started as Arild Fines' final year development project at the Engineering Faculty of the Oslo College in Norway. Karl Fogel (one of the Subversion &ldquo;originals&rdquo;) was Arild&rsquo;s outside mentor. Arild continued the project while pursuing a master's degree in Informatics at the University of Oslo. Nowadays, AnkhSVN is a true open source project under an Apache-style license. Arild continue to leads the project with multiple committers developing the code. </p><p>In&nbsp;Februari 2008 the decision was made to rewrite&nbsp;the AnkhSVN engine to&nbsp;create a full Source Code Control Package (SCC)&nbsp;for Visual Studio 2005, 2008&nbsp;and later. The new&nbsp;engine will be the heart of the new 2.0 release which will see its initial release in June 2008. This new version integrates deeply in Visual Studio to give better performance, stability&nbsp;and usability. The new Pending Changes window is the heart of the new integration. It&nbsp;gives an up-to-date overview of all&nbsp;your project actions and provides easy access to most subversion commands. Daily builds of the work in progress are available on our <a title="AnkhSVN Downloads" href="http://ankhsvn.net/downloads/">downloads page</a>.</p><p>CollabNet hosts and supports the AnkhSVN project with the goal to accelerate growth of the AnkhSVN community and adoption by development organizations around the world. CollabNet also contributes code to the project. </p><p><a href="/servlets/ProjectProcess?tab=4">Get involved with AnkhSVN!</a> </p>
