 <h2><b>Using the features of Ankh </b></h2> 
<p><a name="1"></a><b>AnkhSVN doesn't work for this project but TortoiseSVN works fine</b></p>
 
<p>The default directory for Subversion clients administrative data is &quot;.svn&quot; however Visual Studio has some issues with directories beginning with a . and so some clients use &quot;_svn&quot; instead.</p>
 
<p>If you have TortoiseSVN set to use &quot;_svn&quot; then you should also tell AnkhSVN to do this too as per the following question.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/cn-project-pages/Community%20Support/#totop"><img src="../../../images/gotop.gif" width="14" height="12"></a></p>
 
<p><a name="2"></a><b>How do I make AnkhSVN use &quot;_svn&quot; instead of &quot;.svn&quot;?</b></p>
 
<p>Open Visual Studio without a project loaded.</p>
 
<p>From within Visual Studio choose Tools -&gt; AnkhSVN -&gt; Edit the AnkhSVN configuration.</p>
 
<p>Under Category &quot;Subversion&quot;, key AdminDirectoryName put in the value &quot;_svn&quot;</p>
 
<p>Hit OK.</p>
 
<p>Now open up a solution that is versioned with subversion and enable it for AnkhSVN.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/cn-project-pages/Community%20Support/#totop">Top</a></p>
 
<p><a name="3"></a><b>How do I identify the version of AnkhSVN I am using?</b></p>
 
<p>From within Visual Studo choose Help -&gt; About Microsoft Visual Studio</p>
 
<p>In the dialog that is shown choose AnkhSVN from &quot;Installed products&quot; and the version details will then be displayed in &quot;Product details&quot;.</p>
 
<p>Note both these lists may require scrolling to find AnkhSVN and the version numbers.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/cn-project-pages/Community%20Support/#totop">Top</a></p>
 
<p><a name="4"></a><b>Some project settings not preserved across checkin/checkout (ie. Working Directory). Why?</b></p>
 
<p>Those settings are considered to be the local user project options and they are not meant to be version controled by definition. (FYI they are not stored in the .vcproj / .csproj but in the .suo / .csproj.user Visual Studio user option files)</p>
 
<p><a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/cn-project-pages/Community%20Support/#totop">Top</a></p>
 
<p><a name="5"></a><b>Does subversion support locking of files? IE is there an equivalent of &quot;checked out by me&quot;, &quot;checked by other&quot; as in Visual Source Safe?</b></p>
 
<p>Yes, later snapshots of AnkhSVN supports locking via the Lock and Unlock commands. It also has icons to indicate the lock status of a file.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/cn-project-pages/Community%20Support/#totop">Top</a></p>
 
<p><b><a name="6"></a>How does Ankh determine whether a solution is version controlled?</b></p>
 
<p>Whenever VS.NET loads a solution, Ankh looks at the directory that contains the solution(.sln) file. If this directory is version controlled, Ankh will present the user with a choice whether Ankh should be enabled for the current solution. You can also choose to have Ankh load for a single session only.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/cn-project-pages/Community%20Support/#totop">Top</a></p>
 
<p><a name="7"></a><b>I selected No when asked whether to load Ankh for my solution. Now I have changed my mind!</b></p>
 
<p>Right click on the solution node in the Solution Explorer and select Ankh-&gt;Toggle Ankh for this solution.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/cn-project-pages/Community%20Support/#totop">Top</a></p>
 
<p><b><a name="8"></a>What is the optimal solution layout for Ankh?</b></p>
 
<p>Ankh will perform best(solution load time, refresh time etc...) when the file system layout of the solution follows the logical layout. That means something like this:</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p> SolutionDir\</p>
 
<p>    Solution.sln</p>
 
<p>    Project1\</p>
 
<p>       File1.cs</p>
 
<p>       File2.cs</p>
 
<p>       SubNamespace\</p>
 
<p>          File3.cs</p>
 
<p>          File4.cs</p>
 
<p>       Project1.csproj</p>
 
<p>    Project2\</p>
 
<p>       Foo.vb</p>
 
<p>       Bar.vb</p>
 
<p>       SubFoo\</p>
 
<p>           Moo.vb</p>
 
<p>       Project2.vbproj</p>
 
<p>    Project3</p>
 
<p>       Ooga.cpp</p>
 
<p>       Ooga.h</p>
 
<p>       Chacka.cpp</p>
 
<p>       Chacka.h</p>
 
<p>       Project3.vcproj</p>
 
<p>VS will create this kind of layout for you if you check the &quot;Create directory for solution&quot; checkbox when creating a new project.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/cn-project-pages/Community%20Support/#totop">Top</a></p>
 
<p><b><a name="9"></a>But I can't create a layout like that with ASP.NET 2003 projects! VS places the ASP.NET projects under wwwroot</b></p>
 
<p>That 'is' the default layout, yes. However, it is quite possible to put an ASP.NET project anywhere in the file system.</p>
 
<p>Assume you have laid out the solution according to the above(either by creating other projects or by making a blank solution):</p>
 
<p>These instructions only work in VS 2003:</p>
 
<p>    * Create the directory under the solution directory that is to hold the ASP.NET project, f.ex WebProject</p>
 
<p>    * Go into the Properties dialog of that folder and click the Web Sharing tab</p>
 
<p>    * Click &quot;Share this folder&quot; and enter a suitable name, f.ex mywebproject</p>
 
<p>    * In VS.NET, right click the solution and choose Add-&gt;New project</p>
 
<p>    * Select ASP.NET project and enter http://localhost/mywebproject as the URL</p>
 
<p>    * VS.NET will now create the solution under SolutionDir\WebProject</p>

<p> <a name="10"></a><b>I can't figure out how to add a new project via AnkhSVN and yes, I read the Getting Started page</b></p>
 
<p>There is a good chance that Visual Studio is not showing you the Solution node in Solution Explorer. To rectify this, go to the menu bar and click Tools &gt; Options &gt; Projects and Solutions, and check the box next to 'Always show solution.' After clicking OK, right click on the solution node to bring up the context menu, follow the Getting Started instructions from there.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/cn-project-pages/Community%20Support/#totop">Top</a></p>
 
<p><a name="11"></a><b>How do I create a proper layout for ASP in Visual Studio 2005?</b></p>
 
<p>* Open Visual Studio and create a blank solution file (File&gt;New Project&gt;Other Project Types&gt;Visual Studio Solutions&gt;Blank Solution)</p>
 
<p>    * Right Click on the empty solution file in the Solution Explorer and Click Add&gt;New Website...</p>
 
<p>    * Browse to the place you just created and then in the Location textbox add a new subdirectory name onto the end of the path</p>
 
<p>    * Create some content, if desired</p>
 
<p>    * Click File&gt;Add Solution to Subversion Repository...</p>
 
<p>Every time you open your ASP project you MUST use the Open Project command to browse to the .sln file you created instead of using the Open Website command. Anytime you use the Open Website command you will create a superfluous solution file (default is under My Documents\Visual Studio\Projects) that is not under subversion source control.</p>

 <h2>Using Ankh with other software</h2> 
<p><a name="12"></a><b>H</b><b>ow can I set up a Subversion server on Windows?</b></p>
 
<p>Here are instructions for setting up an Apache server on Windows: http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/docs/TortoiseSVN_en/ch03.html.</p>

<p><a name="13"></a>What versions of VS.NET does Ankh run on?</p>
 
<p>Ankh currently supports VS.NET 2002, VS.NET 2003 and VS 2005. It is the same install file (msi) for all versions.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/cn-project-pages/Community%20Support/#totop">Top</a></p>
 
<p><a name="14"></a><b>D</b><b>oes it work with the Visual Studio 2005 Express versions?</b></p>
 
<p>No, and it might never do so. The current position from Microsoft is that these SKUs will not support addins. At all. Hopefully they will reverse their position.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/cn-project-pages/Community%20Support/#totop">Top</a></p>
 
<p><b><a name="15"></a>I am using Visual </b><b>Studio Express and it seems to support Visual Studio Express - I downloaded and installed TestDriven.NET plugin and it worked perfectly</b></p>
 
<p>Unfortunately, Testdriven .NET was forced to drop the versions that supported Visual Studio Express, after pressure from Microsoft. We see little need to get into the same troubles with Microsoft. See this blog entry for some background on this.</p>

<p><b><a name="16"></a>What else do I need to have installed to use Ankh?</b></p>
 
<p>Ankh links into the same libraries that svn.exe does, so if the Subversion repository is already created it is possible to use Ankh without ever installing Subversion at all. However, with Ankh you cannot yet do some things, including but not limited to creating a repository, merging, copying or moving. It is highly recommended that Subversion be installed as well at this point. You can download Subversion from http://subversion.tigris.org. Other than that all you need is VS.NET.</p>

<p><b><a name="17"></a>Can I use Ankh with CVS?</b></p>
 
<p>No, Ankh only works with subversion, it will not work with CVS. To use CVS with VS.NET Jalindi Igloo is available at http://www.jalindi.com/igloo.</p>

<p><b><a name="18"></a>Why would I want to use subversion and not Visual SourceSafe?</b></p>
 
<p>Here is a discussion on that Topic: http://www.wadhome.org/svn_vs_vss.html</p>

<p><b><a name="19"></a>How do I convert my Visual Sourcesafe repository to SVN?</b></p>
 
<p>See the vss2svn project at http://vss2svn.tigris.org/</p>

<p><b><a name="20"></a>Why doesn't Ankh work with Intel Compiler projects/{insert favorite project type here}</b></p>
 
<p>In VS.NET, every vendor that provides a project type is also responsible for implementing its automation model. In some cases, they do a less than stellar job, and this leaves Ankh in a position where it cannot get the information it needs.</p>

<p><b><a name="21"></a>I am using svnserve, when I attempt to do a commit to the remote repository i get a Permission denied error. How do i set up user accounts for svnserve?</b></p>
 
<p>Svnserve has built-in authentication and authorization. You can setup users and realms within your /path-to-repos/conf/svnserve.conf file. See http://svnbook.red-bean.com/svnbook-1.0/ch06s03.html for instructions.</p>

<p><b><a name="22"></a>I'm trying use svn+ssh but i get an error dialog when I try to checkout or update.</b></p>
 
<p>You may not have an ssh client available. You can specify the full path to the client in the c:\Documents and Settings\YOURUSERNAME\Application Data\Subversion\config. Make sure you uncomment the # tunnels section and add a line like this:</p>
 
<p>ssh = c:\\Program\ Files\\TortoiseSVN\\bin\\TortoisePlink.exe</p>
 
<p>(note the double \ characters and the single \ to escape the space ) </p>

 <h2>Errors</h2> 
<p><b><a name="24"></a>I get an error saying &quot;URI formats not supported&quot;</b></p>
 
<p>This has been fixed in the upcoming 1.0 RC4.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/cn-project-pages/Community%20Support/#totop">Top</a></p>
 
<p><b><a name="25"></a>I get an error saying &quot;Cannot copy or move file: it's not in the repository yet. Try committing first&quot;</b></p>
 
<p>Subversion (and Ankh by consequence) does not allow you to rename items that have been added, but not committed. If you need to do this, first perform a &quot;Revert&quot; on the item, then do the rename and read it.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/cn-project-pages/Community%20Support/#totop">Top</a></p>
 
<p><b><a name="26"></a>I get an error saying &quot;Failed to add file: object of the same name exists&quot;</b></p>
 
<p>This means that someone else has added a file with this name to the repository. When updating, Subversion will refuse to overwrite unversioned files. You have to move the unversioned file out of the way first.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/cn-project-pages/Community%20Support/#totop">Top</a></p>
 
<p><b><a name="27"></a>I get an error saying &quot;This client is too old to work with working copy; please get a newer Subversion client</b></p>
 
<p>Subversion 1.4 introduced a new working copy format. As a consequence, all clients linking to SVN 1.4 libraries will automatically upgrade any working copies they come into contact with, leaving the working copy unusable by older clients.</p>
  
<p>AnkhSVN 1.0 (RC) is linked to SVN 1.4, so upgrading will solve the problem.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/cn-project-pages/Community%20Support/#totop">Top</a></p>
 
<p><b><a name="29"></a>When committing, I get an error saying Aborting commit: file remains in conflict</b></p>
 
<p>This means you have a file that is in conflict, ie, someone else has made a change that conflicts with one of yours. You will have to resolve the conflict before proceeding. This can be done by editing the conflict markers in the file, then doing Ankh-&gt;Resolve on the file in question.</p>
 
<p>Alternatively, you can pick which version of the file you want to resolve in the Resolve dialog, or use an external merge tool (you need to set up one in the configuration dialog for this).</p>

<p><b><a name="30"></a>If I do a &quot;Replace In Files&quot;, Ankh doesn't notice that the files have changed.</b></p>
 
<p>If you want to do &quot;Replace In Files&quot; on files controlled by Ankh, make sure to check the checkbox in the dialog that comes up. This will make VS open all the affected files in the document editor and force you to do an explicit &quot;Save All&quot; in order to finalize the changes. Ankh will notice in this case.</p>

<p><b><a name="32"></a>I am getting the error &quot;Unable to retrieve folder information from the server with my ASP.NET web project&quot;.</b></p>
 
<p>This problem is described in detail here: http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&amp;msgNo=60681 The best solution is to have Ankh use _svn as the name of the Subversion administrative directory instead. This can be done in the configuration dialog (Tools-&gt;AnkhSVN-&gt;Edit AnkhSVN configuration).</p>
 
<p>===I get an error saying &quot;The version resource does not correspond to the resource within the transaction.&quot; Running Update on the item in question solves this problem.</p>

<p><b><a name="32"></a>I get an error saying &quot;PROPFIND of ...: 405 Method Not Allowed&quot;</b></p>
 
<p>This usually means you are trying to perform a Subversion operation against an URL that isn't set up as a Subversion repository.</p>

<p><b><a name="33"></a>I uninstalled Ankh, but the menu entries are still there, how can I get rid of them?</b></p>
 
<p>You can run devenv /setup from the command line which will set VS.NET back to the default state. However if you have any VS.NET customizations you may lose them.</p>

<p><b><a name="34"></a>I am getting an svn client error exception for svn_io_file_open: can't open (then a path to a file with a .projdata or a .ncb extension)</b></p>
 
<p>You cannot put the .projdata file under Subversion version control. VS.NET puts a pretty tight lock on that whenever a solution is loaded - other applications cannot even read from it. In fact, this exact scenario was used for an Ankh presentation to demonstrate how the error reporting worked. This file is generated by VS.NET, doesn't have much of interest in it, and there's no reason to put it under version control anyway. Other generated files that should never be put under version control include but are not limited to files of type .user, .suo, .obj, .exe, .pdb and dll.</p>
 
<p>We recommend adding .projdata and some of the other file types to the global-ignores section in your %APPDATA%\Subversion\config file. This will ensure that they don't get accidentally imported if you use other clients to add your code to the repository. If you use Ankh-&gt;Add solution to repository, Ankh will of course ignore these files automatically.</p>
 
<p>Here is a sample global-ignores:</p>
 
<p> miscellany</p>
 
<p> ### Set global-ignores to a set of whitespace-delimited globs</p>
 
<p> ### which Subversion will ignore in its 'status' output.</p>
 
<p> global-ignores = *.projdata *.pdb *.exe *.dll obj tmp temp bin *proj.user *.o *.obj *.ncb *.suo *.pyc</p>

<p>This is caused by a bug in the installer of either Whidbey or the Express SKUs. To fix:</p>
 
<p>  &gt; cd %windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322 </p>
 
<p>  &gt; regasm /codebase envdte.dll</p>
 
<p>The last line will give you a warning, but it's not dangerous.</p>
