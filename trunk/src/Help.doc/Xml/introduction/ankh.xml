        The aim of this project was to provide an integration for the revision control 
        system Subversion (SVN) into the existing coding environment provided by Visual Studio .NET. 
        Most Windows users are not found of using command prompts which is needed by the 
        use of Subversion today. 
        <br/><br/>
        By creating Ankh, SVN will be made available for a huge amount of new Windows programmers, 
        and will also ease revision control for programmers already using subversion and Visual Studio .NET. 
        Benefits of the addin will be that SVN is accessed directly from within VS.NET 
        itself which will lead to increased productivity since revision control is directly accessible 
        in VS.NET. Ankh and Subversion are both open source.
