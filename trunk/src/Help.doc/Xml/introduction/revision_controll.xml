        In a typical software development environment, many developers will be engaged in work on 
        one code base. If everyone was to be allowed to edit and modify any development item whenever 
        they felt like it, it should be obvious that chaos would tend to result while little 
        productive work got done. Instead of suffering under such an environment, 
        most developers prefer to implement version control tools such as the one described here. 
        Version control tools allow an individual developer to maintain control over an item 
        such as a source file while they implement and test changes to it. 
        <br/><br/>
        During this period, while the file is "checked out", no one else is allowed to modify it. 
        When the developer is satisfied that the changes have been implemented successfully and 
        that they broke nothing in the meantime, the file may be "checked in" to the baseline 
        database for use by everyone.
