                <br/>
                Copy a file in a working copy or in the repository. SRC and DST can each be either a working copy (WC) path or URL:
                <br/><br/>
                WC -> WC
                <br/>
                Copy and schedule an item for addition (with history).
                <br/>
                WC -> URL
                <br/>
                Immediately commit a copy of WC to URL.
                <br/>
                URL -> WC
                <br/>
                Check out URL into WC, and schedule it for addition.
                <br/>
                URL -> URL
                <br/>
                Complete server-side copy. This is usually used to branch and tag.
