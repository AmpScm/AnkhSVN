     <section header="Abstract"> 
		<p>The development of Subversion (svn)
		plugin for Visual Studio .NET will be conducted as a
		final project at HIO in cooperation with CollabNet.
		First step is to make a .NET wrapper for the
		Subversion's client API, thereby use this wrapper to
		create a Visual Studio .NET addin for svn. We
		intend to write most of the system in the C#
		programming language.</p> 
     </section>

     <section header="Background"> 
		<p>Subversion is a free open source tool which makes it easier
        for several people to work within the same set of files. The
        files are placed into a central repository. The repository
        is much like an ordinary file server, except that it
        remembers every change ever made to your files. Each
        individual programmer checks out a workingcopy. During the
        project period these working copies can be updated and
        synchronised with the repository. Today you have to write
        commands in a prompt while using Subversion. Our 
        intention is to integrate the revision control system into the platform
        where the programming actually is performed, and make it more user friendly
        by offering menus instead of commands. We therefor intend to make both a 
        "GUI/plugin .NET layer" and a .NET wrapper layer.</p>

		<p>The background for this specific
		project is that we wanted to do a project in the Microsoft's
		.NET environment. One of the group member had used
		Subversion for several school and private projects for the last year.</p>
		
		<p>We decided to do a project
		where both technologies were represented. After having
		defined the project we contacted CollabNet. CollabNet provided the initial 
		founding in 2000 to begin development work of Subversion and today pays 
		the salary for several people that works on the Subversion project. CollabNet 
		offers a wide range of products and services to improve software quality and 
		accelerate time-to-market during product development. Their main product is 
		SourceCast which is a Web-based software development platform. 
		Subversion is aimed to be the successor of the existing revision control system (CVS)
		integrated in the SourceCast platform. Our intention is to integrate Subversion into 
		a "second" platform environment by making an addin in Visual Studio .NET. The free 
		useful open source tool will thereby get a new audience and hopefully a
		huge amount of new users. CollabNet provides our external 
		supervisor, Karl Fogel.

    <section header="Aim"> 
		<p>The aim of this project is to provide an
		integration for Subversion into the existing
		coding environment Visual Studio .NET. By making a plugin for
		Visual Studio .NET the revision control system can be
		made available for a huge amount of new users. We
		also hope to make the .NET wrapper layer available as a
		standalone component so that it easily can be used in
		other applications in the future.</p> 
   </section>

    <section header="External conditions"> 
        <p>The group will have
        weekly meetings with the HIO/IU supervisor, Eva H.Vihovde
        Fridays at 2 PM.</p>

        <p>Every Monday from 8:30 AM and Fridays from 1:30 PM the
        group will work at the dedicated school PC. The group intends to
        work together until all the group members are familiar with
        the software to be used. At a later stage in the project it
        will be possible to work separately at individual home
        computers as the communication easily can happen via
        instant messaging systems. The purpose with these meetings
        is to assess the quality of the work completed and plan
        the next steps.</p>

        <p>Through the project periode we will continuously give
        information of project news and progress in an online
        diary.</p>

        <p>We have tried to define individual roles for each group
        member based on individual preferences and skills. Arild will
        be the main contact person towards the Employer CollabNet. Per
        will be the main contact person towards the computer
        department. Kristin will be responsible for a weekly resume to
        the HIO/IU supervisor Eva H. Vihovde in the group meetings
        based on contribution from all the group members. The roles are
        not definite and could be adjusted through the project
        process.</p>

        <p>To enforce an overall consistent look of the code we will
        compose a set of common programming guidelines.</p>

        <p>Subversion will be used for revision control both for
        the source code and documentation. Guidelines will be
        composed for how comments etc. are to be written.</p>

        <p>To ensure the sanity and quality of the system at any given moment,
        and to catch regression bugs we intend to conduct continuous
        unit tests using the <link
        url="http://nunit.sourceforge.net/">Nunit</link> testing
        framework.</p>

        <p>We hope to make the .NET wrapper layer available as a
        standalone unit for use in other applications. We also hope
        to provide <link url="http://nant.sourceforge.net/">Nant
        </link> build scripts that will enable it to be built
        without requiring the user to have Visual Studio.NET
        installed. </p>

        <p>We intend to perform code reviews on a regular basis.</p>

        <p>Guidelines for how the documentation to be written in
        XML will be composed. The intention is to transform these
        XML documents into both HTML and into a format suitable for
        printing using XSL.</p>

        <p>There are some open source code for addins of common
        revision control systems and available code of addins in
        .NET in general which we hope to learn from.</p> 
    </section>

    <section header="Implementation choices"> 
        <p>We primarily intend to
        write most of the system in the C# programming language.
        However, it might be beneficial to consider alternative
        approaches in certain areas of the project. For example, it
        might be a better choice to write the .NET wrapper layer
        in Managed C++(C++ extensions for the .NET environment) since
        this offers better integration with a C-based API such as that of
        Subversion. Another alternative might be to use a tool called
        <link url="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</link>(Simplified Wrapper
        and Interface Generator) - a tool that generates wrappers for C
        and C++-based APIs automagically. We will have to research
        these alternatives more thoroughly and also seek advice from
        other people with knowledge in the area.</p> 
    </section>

    <section header="Conclusion"> 
        <p>Subversion integration with
        Visual Studio .NET can potentially make the revision control system
        available to a huge amount of new users.</p>
