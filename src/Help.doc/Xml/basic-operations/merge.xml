                <br/>
                    In the first form, URL1 and URL2 are URLs specified at revisions N and M. 
                    These are the two sources to be compared. The revisions default to HEAD if omitted.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In the second form TARGET can be a URL, or it can be a working copy path, 
                    in which case the corresponding URL is used. This URL, at revisions N and M, 
                    defines the two sources to be compared.
                    <br/><br/>
                    PATH is the working copy path that will receive the changes. 
                    <br/><br/>
